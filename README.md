# TailwindCSS Starter Kit

Starter project I use when creating statics HTML sites using TailwindCSS

## Libraries used
TailwindCSS, NodeJS, NPM, PostCSS, GulpJS, PurgeJS, http-server

## Running local server
Ensure that you have **node** and **npm** installed before running running the project.

```
npm install
```
To simplify the process of running your code locally, you can using the simple and amazing [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to run your code locally. You can install it globally using:
### Install http-server
```
npm install --g http-server
```
### Install Gulp
```
npm install --g gulp
```
### Build the CSS
```
npm run build
```
